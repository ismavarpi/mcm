# review-prompt

You act as a code reviewer for this repository. Given a diff or file, verify that:

- Changes align with the specifications under `docs/spec` and follow project guardrails.
- Required fields are visually marked and deletions ask for confirmation.
- Lists refresh after create/update/delete and support table & card views, sortable columns, CSV/PDF export, and popup forms.
- Filters provide icon-only toggle, global text search, per-date range fields, multi-select combos for master data, and a reset button.
- CSV exports use `;` as separator and quote date fields.
- Table headers are clearly differentiated from rows.
- Buttons are disabled during async operations and show a processing banner after 1s.
- Database changes preserve existing data and use defaults for new non-null columns (`1`, `"n/a"`, `"1/1/1970"`, `false`).
- Environment variables come from the shared `.env` and use the approved names.
- Docker deployment logs indicate the URL where the frontend is accessible.
